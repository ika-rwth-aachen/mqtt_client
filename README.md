The *mqtt_client* package provides a ROS nodelet or ROS 2 component node that enables connected ROS-based and non-ROS-based devices or robots to exchange ROS messages via an MQTT broker using the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) protocol. This works generically for arbitrary ROS message types. The *mqtt_client* can also exchange primitive messages with MQTT clients running on devices not based on ROS.

## Installation

The *mqtt_client* package is released as an official ROS / ROS 2 package and can easily be installed via a package manager.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-mqtt-client
```

If you would like to install *mqtt_client* from source, simply clone this repository into your ROS workspace. All dependencies that are listed in the ROS [`package.xml`](package.xml) can be installed using [*rosdep*](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep).

```bash
# mqtt_client$
rosdep install -r --ignore-src --from-paths .

# ROS
# workspace$
catkin build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release mqtt_client

# ROS 2
# workspace$
colcon build --packages-up-to mqtt_client --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### docker-ros

*mqtt_client* is also available as a Docker image, containerized through [*docker-ros*](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/docker-ros).

```bash
# ROS
docker run --rm ghcr.io/ika-rwth-aachen/mqtt_client:ros

# ROS 2
docker run --rm ghcr.io/ika-rwth-aachen/mqtt_client:ros2
```


## Usage

The *mqtt_client* can be easily integrated into an existing ROS-based system. Below, you first find a quick start guide to test the *mqtt_client* on a single machine. Then, more details are presented on how to launch and configure it in more complex applications.

### Quick Start

Follow these steps to quickly launch a working *mqtt_client* that is sending ROS messages via an MQTT broker to itself.

#### Demo Broker

It is assumed that an MQTT broker (such as [*Mosquitto*](https://mosquitto.org/)) is running on `localhost:1883`.

For this demo, you may easily launch *Mosquitto* with its default configuration using *Docker*.

```bash
docker run --rm --network host --name mosquitto eclipse-mosquitto
```

For a more advanced setup of your own broker, check out our instructions for running an MQTT broker in Docker with enabled authentication and encryption [here](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/mqtt-in-docker).

#### Demo Configuration

The *mqtt_client* is best configured with a ROS parameter *yaml* file. The configuration shown below (also see [`params.yaml`](mqtt_client/config/params.yaml) / [`params.ros2.yaml`](mqtt_client/config/params.ros2.yaml)) allows an exchange of messages as follows:

- ROS messages received locally on ROS topic `/ping/ros` are sent to the broker on MQTT topic `pingpong/ros`;
- MQTT messages received from the broker on MQTT topic `pingpong/ros` are published locally on ROS topic `/pong/ros`;
- primitive ROS messages received locally on ROS topic `/ping/primitive` are sent as primitive (string) messages to the broker on MQTT topic `pingpong/primitive`;
- MQTT messages received from the broker on MQTT topic `pingpong/primitive` are published locally as primitive ROS messages on ROS topic `/pong/primitive`.
- ROS messages received locally on ROS topic `/ping/json` are sent to the broker in JSON format on MQTT topic `pingpong/json`;
- MQTT messages received from the broker on MQTT topic `pingpong/json` are recieved as JSON and published locally as a ROS message on ROS topic `/pong/json`;
```yaml
broker:
  host: localhost
  port: 1883
bridge:
  ros2mqtt:
    - ros_topic: /ping/ros
      mqtt_topic: pingpong/ros
    - ros_topic: /ping/primitive
      mqtt_topic: pingpong/primitive
      primitive: true
    - ros_topic: /ping/json
      mqtt_topic: pingpong/json
      json: true
  mqtt2ros:
    - mqtt_topic: pingpong/ros
      ros_topic: /pong/ros
    - mqtt_topic: pingpong/primitive
      ros_topic: /pong/primitive
      primitive: true
    - mqtt_topic: pingpong/json
      ros_topic: /pong/json
      json: true
```

#### Demo Client Launch

After building your ROS workspace, launch the *mqtt_client* node with the pre-configured demo parameters using *roslaunch*, which should yield the following output.

```bash
# ROS
roslaunch mqtt_client standalone.launch

# ROS 2
ros2 launch mqtt_client standalone.launch.ros2.xml
```

```txt

[ INFO] [1665575657.462622065]: Connected to broker at 'tcp://localhost:1883'
```

Note that the *mqtt_client* successfully connected to the broker and also echoed which ROS/MQTT topics are being bridged. For testing the communication between *mqtt_client*, itself, and other MQTT clients, open eight new terminals.

In order to test the communication among *mqtt_clients*, publish any ROS message on ROS topic `/ping/ros` and wait for a response on ROS topic `/pong/ros`.

```bash
# 1st terminal: publish ROS message to /ping

# ROS
rostopic pub -r 1 /ping/ros std_msgs/String "Hello MQTT"

# ROS 2
ros2 topic pub /ping/ros std_msgs/msg/String "{data: \"Hello MQTT\"}"
```

```bash
# 2nd terminal: listen for ROS messages on /pong

# ROS
rostopic echo /pong/ros

# ROS 2
ros2 topic echo /pong/ros
```

In order to test the communication between *mqtt_client* and other MQTT clients, publish a ROS message on ROS topic `/ping/json`, directly publish a json MQTT message on MQTT topic `pingpong/json` and wait for responses on ROS topic `/pong/json`.

```bash
# 3rd terminal: publish ROS message to /ping/json

# ROS
rostopic pub -r 1 /ping/json geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  seq: 1
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: 'map'
pose:
  position:
    x: 1.0
    y: 2.0
    z: 3.0
  orientation:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
    w: 1.0"

# ROS2

ros2 topic pub /ping/json geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{header: {stamp: {sec: 1, nanosec: 50}, frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: 1.2, y: 3.4, z: 5.6}, orientation: {x: 7.8, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}}'


```

```bash
# 4th terminal: listen for primitive ROS messages on /pong/json

# ROS
rostopic echo /pong/json

# ROS2
ros2 topic echo /pong/json

```

```bash
# 5th terminal: publish primitive MQTT message to pingpong/json directly using mosquitto_pub
docker run --rm --network host eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "pingpong/json" --repeat 20 --repeat-delay 1 -m "{\"header\":{\"seq\":1,\"stamp\":{\"secs\":0,\"nsecs\":0},\"frame_id\":\"map\"},\"pose\":{\"position\":{\"x\":1.0,\"y\":2.0,\"z\":0.0},\"orientation\":{\"x\":0.0,\"y\":0.0,\"z\":0.0,\"w\":1.0}}}"

```

In order to test the communication between *mqtt_client* and other MQTT clients for primitive messages, publish a primitive ROS message on ROS topic `/ping/primitive`, directly publish a primitive MQTT message on MQTT topic `pingpong/primitive` and wait for responses on ROS topic `/pong/primitive`. Note that you need to restart the ROS 2 *mqtt_client* with a different config file.

```bash
# ROS 2
# mqtt_client$
ros2 launch mqtt_client standalone.launch.ros2.xml params_file:=$(ros2 pkg prefix mqtt_client)/share/mqtt_client/config/params.ros2.primitive.yaml
```

```bash
# 6th terminal: publish primitive ROS message to /ping/primitive

# ROS
rostopic pub -r 1 /ping/primitive std_msgs/Int32 42

# ROS2
ros2 topic pub /ping/primitive std_msgs/msg/Int32 "{data: 42}"
```

```bash
# 7th terminal: listen for primitive ROS messages on /pong/primitive

# ROS
rostopic echo /pong/primitive

# ROS2
ros2 topic echo /pong/primitive
```

```bash
# 8th terminal: publish primitive MQTT message to pingpong/primitive directly using mosquitto_pub
docker run --rm --network host eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "pingpong/primitive" --repeat 20 --repeat-delay 1 -m 69
```

If everything works as expected, the second terminal should print a message at 1Hz, while the fourth terminal should print two different messages at 1Hz.

### Launch

You can start the *mqtt_client* node with:

```bash
# ROS
roslaunch mqtt_client standalone.launch

# ROS 2
ros2 launch mqtt_client standalone.launch.ros2.xml
```

This will automatically load the provided demo [`params.yaml`](mqtt_client/config/params.yaml) / [`params.ros2.yaml`](mqtt_client/config/params.ros2.yaml). If you wish to load your custom configuration file, simply pass `params_file`.

```bash
# ROS
roslaunch mqtt_client standalone.launch params_file:="</PATH/TO/PARAMS.YAML>"

# ROS 2
ros2 launch mqtt_client standalone.launch.ros2.xml params_file:="</PATH/TO/PARAMS.YAML>"
```

In order to exploit the benefits of *mqtt_client* being a ROS nodelet / ROS 2 component, load the nodelet / component to your own nodelet manager / component container.

          latched:             # [false] whether to latch ROS message
```


## JSON Messages

As seen in the [Quick Start](#quick-start), the *mqtt_client* can not only exchange arbitrary ROS messages with other *mqtt_clients*, but it can also exchange arbitrary messages with other non-*mqtt_client* MQTT clients using JSON. This allows ROS-based devices to exchange ROS messages with devices not based on ROS, and non-*mqtt_client* MQTT clients can send a JSON string with a format that matches the needed ROS message to be casted into. The `json` parameter can be set for both ROS-to-MQTT (`bridge/ros2mqtt`) and for MQTT-to-ROS (`bridge/mqtt2ros`) transmissions.

If a ROS-to-MQTT transmission is configured as `json`, the message is published as a serialized JSON string.

If an MQTT-to-ROS transmission is configured as `json`, the MQTT message is interpreted as a JSON string and transformed into a ROS message to be published.

The `json` property of both Ros-to-MQTT and MQTT-to-ROS should be equal.

## Primitive Messages

Additionally, the *mqtt_client* can also exchange primitive message data with other non-*mqtt_client* MQTT clients. This allows ROS-based devices to exchange primitive messages with devices not based on ROS. The `primitive` parameter can be set for both ROS-to-MQTT (`bridge/ros2mqtt`) and for MQTT-to-ROS (`bridge/mqtt2ros`) transmissions.

If a ROS-to-MQTT transmission is configured as `primitive` and the ROS message type is one of the supported primitive ROS message types, the raw data is published as a string. The supported primitive ROS message types are [`std_msgs/String`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/String.html), [`std_msgs/Bool`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Bool.html), [`std_msgs/Char`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Char.html), [`std_msgs/UInt8`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/UInt8.html), [`std_msgs/UInt16`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/UInt16.html), [`std_msgs/UInt32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/UInt32.html), [`std_msgs/UInt64`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/UInt16.html), [`std_msgs/Int8`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int8.html), [`std_msgs/Int16`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int16.html), [`std_msgs/Int32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int32.html), [`std_msgs/Int64`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int64.html), [`std_msgs/Float32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Float32.html), [`std_msgs/Float32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Float64.html).

If an MQTT-to-ROS transmission is configured as `primitive`, the MQTT message is interpreted and published as a primitive data type, if possible. The message is probed in the following order: `bool` ([`std_msgs/Bool`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Bool.html)), `int` ([`std_msgs/Int32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Int32.html)), `float` ([`std_msgs/Float32`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Float32.html)), `string` ([`std_msgs/String`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_msgs/html/msg/String.html)).

## Latency Computation

The *mqtt_client* provides built-in functionality to measure the latency of transferring a ROS message via an MQTT broker back to ROS. Note that this functionality is only available for non-primitive messages (see [Primitive Messages](#primitive-messages)). To this end, the sending client injects the current timestamp into the MQTT message. The receiving client can then compute the latency between message reception time and the injected timestamp. **Naturally, this is only accurate to the level of synchronization between clocks on sending and receiving machine.**

In order to inject the current timestamp into outgoing MQTT messages, the parameter `inject_timestamp` has to be set for the corresponding `bridge/ros2mqtt` entry. The receiving *mqtt_client* will then automatically publish the measured latency in seconds as a ROS `std_msgs/Float64` message on topic `/<mqtt_client_name>/latencies/<mqtt2ros/ros_topic>`.

These latencies can be printed easily with *rostopic echo*

```bash
# ROS
rostopic echo --clear /<mqtt_client_name>/latencies/<mqtt2ros/ros_topic>/data

# ROS 2
ros2 topic echo /<mqtt_client_name>/latencies/<mqtt2ros/ros_topic>/data
```

or plotted with [rqt_plot](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_plot):

```bash
# ROS
rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot /<mqtt_client_name>/latencies/<mqtt2ros/ros_topic>/data

# ROS 2
ros2 run rqt_plot rqt_plot /<mqtt_client_name>/latencies/<mqtt2ros/ros_topic>/data
```

## How It Works

### ROS

The *mqtt_client* is able to bridge ROS messages of arbitrary message type to an MQTT broker. In addition, it is able to exchange arbitrary ROS messages with non-ROS-based devices, using JSON interpretations of ROS messages. To this end, it needs to employ generic ROS subscribers, publishers, and JSON parsers, which only take shape at runtime.

The generic JSON parser is realized through the updated version of [RosMsgParser::Parser](https://github.com/ahmad-ra/ros_msg_parser/tree/master), and the generic ROS subscribers and publishers are realized through [topic_tools::ShapeShifter](http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html). For each pair of `ros_topic` and `mqtt_topic` specified under `bridge/ros2mqtt/`, a ROS subscriber is setup with the following callback signature:

```cpp
void ros2mqtt(topic_tools::ShapeShifter::ConstPtr&, std::string&)
```

Inside the callback, the generic messages received on the `ros_topic` are serialized using [ros::serialization](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes). The serialized form is then either sent to the MQTT broker on the specified `mqtt_topic`, or transformed into a serialized JSON representation of the ROS message using [RosMsgParser::Parser::deserializeIntoJson](https://github.com/ahmad-ra/ros_msg_parser/blob/master/include/ros_msg_parser/ros_parser.hpp#L159C10-L159C29) before sending through `mqtt_topic`.

Upon retrieval of an MQTT message, it is republished as a ROS message on the ROS network. To this end, [topic_tools::ShapeShifter::morph](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html#a2b74b522fb49dac05d48f466b6b87d2d) is used to have the ShapeShifter publisher take the shape of the specific ROS message type.

If the recieved MQTT message is in JSON format, it is converted to a serialized ROS message using [RosMsgParser::Parser::serializeFromJson](https://github.com/ahmad-ra/ros_msg_parser/blob/master/include/ros_msg_parser/ros_parser.hpp#L164C10-L164C27) 

The required metainformation on the ROS message type can however only be extracted in the ROS subscriber callback of the publishing *mqtt_client* with calls to [topic_tools::ShapeShifter::getMD5Sum](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html#af05fbf42757658e4c6a0f99ff72f7daa), [topic_tools::ShapeShifter::getDataType](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html#a9d57b2285213fda5e878ce7ebc42f0fb), and [topic_tools::ShapeShifter::getMessageDefinition](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html#a503af7234eeba0ccefca64c4d0cc1df0). These attributes are wrapped in a ROS message of custom type [mqtt_client::RosMsgType](mqtt_client_interfaces/msg/RosMsgType.msg), serialized using [ros::serialization](http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes) and also shared via the MQTT broker on a special topic.

When an *mqtt_client* receives such ROS message type metainformation, it configures the corresponding ROS ShapeShifter publisher using [topic_tools::ShapeShifter::morph](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/topic_tools/html/classtopic__tools_1_1ShapeShifter.html#a2b74b522fb49dac05d48f466b6b87d2d), as well as instantiates a [RosMsgParser::Parser](https://github.com/ahmad-ra/ros_msg_parser/tree/master) object that matched the metainformation.

The *mqtt_client* also provides functionality to measure the latency of transferring a ROS message via an MQTT broker back to ROS. To this end, the sending client injects the current timestamp into the MQTT message. The receiving client can then compute the latency between message reception time and the injected timestamp. The information about whether a timestamp is injected is also included in the custom [mqtt_client::RosMsgType](mqtt_client_interfaces/msg/RosMsgType.msg) message that is sent before. The actual `std::vector<uint8>` message payload takes on one of the following forms:

```txt
[... serialized timestamp ... | ... serialized ROS messsage ...]
[... serialized ROS messsage ...]
```

To summarize, the dataflow is as follows:

- a ROS message of arbitrary type is received on ROS topic `<ros2mqtt_ros_topic>` and passed to the generic callback
  - ROS message type information is extracted and wrapped as a `RosMsgType`
  - ROS message type information is serialized and sent via the MQTT broker on MQTT topic `mqtt_client/ros_msg_type/<ros2mqtt_mqtt_topic>`
  - the actual ROS message is serialized
  - if `inject_timestamp`, the current timestamp is serialized and concatenated with the message
  - the actual MQTT message is sent via the MQTT broker on MQTT topic `<ros2mqtt_mqtt_topic>`
- an MQTT message containing the ROS message type information is received on MQTT topic `mqtt_client/ros_msg_type/<ros2mqtt_mqtt_topic>`
  - message type information is extracted and the ShapeShifter ROS publisher is configured
  - information about whether a timestamp is injected is stored for the specific topic
- an MQTT message containing the actual ROS message is received
  - depending on whether a timestamp is injected, it is decoded into the serialized ROS message and the serialized timestamp
  - if the message contained a timestamp, the latency is computed and published on ROS topic `~/latencies/<mqtt2ros_ros_topic>`
  - the serialized ROS message is published using the *ShapeShifter* on ROS topic `<mqtt2ros_ros_topic>`
